# input programm
# it take value as string and that why it join value not make sum coz in string a + b = ab
a = input("entre no 1:")
b = input ("entre no 2:")
print("number a is :",a)
print("number b is :",b)
print("sum is :", a + b)

# to make it integer so it can actually take sum
a = int(input("entre no 1:")) #int here say make all input it gave a integer
b = int(input ("entre no 2:"))
print("number a is :",a)
print("number b is :",b)
print("sum is :", a + b)
